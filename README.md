## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project was designed to analzye trends between successful, failed, and cancelled goals among campaigns for plays using the data provided. A few visualizations were made in order to better see how these trands occurred and make reasonable changes for goal setting and launch dates in future campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis on the data that I did was a look into the trends on how outcomes were affected by the date that the campaign was launched.  I looked specifically at theater campaigns and how often these goals were achieved based on which months they were launched in.  I set up a pivot table that allows you to see the outcomes of the campaigns in the theater category; however, you can also change the filter in order to see how other categories of campaigns were affected as well.  The table is also set up so that you can dive deeper into one certain year and see how campaigns did in that specific year.  

I then created a line graph to visualize the theater outcomes vs launch dates, as shown below.

As you can see, December was the month in which the number of failed and successful goals were closet to being the same, which leads me to believe that this was the most unsuccessful month based on overall launches.  May had the most successful launches, but it also was the month with the most failed laumches.  This is where this analysis may lack, because rather than showing percentages of failed, successful, and canclelled campaigns, it is only shoiwng the number.  May could have just been the month with the most campsigns overall which is why there were so many successes.
