## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project was designed to analzye trends between successful, failed, and cancelled goals among campaigns for plays using the data provided. A few visualizations were made in order to better see how these trands occurred and make reasonable changes for goal setting and launch dates in future campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis on the data that I did was a look into the trends on how outcomes were affected by the date that the campaign was launched.  I looked specifically at theater campaigns and how often these goals were achieved based on which months they were launched in.  I set up a pivot table that allows you to see the outcomes of the campaigns in the theater category; however, you can also change the filter in order to see how other categories of campaigns were affected as well.  The table is also set up so that you can dive deeper into one certain year and see how campaigns did in that specific year.  

I then created a line graph to visualize the theater outcomes vs launch dates, as shown below.
